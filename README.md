# Angela-Yus-python-bootcampe 
This repository contains the projects I did based on Angela Yu's 100 Days of python bootcamp. 

The projects are done on Replit and since I haven't found a way to link multiple Replit repls into one Github Repository, I just put links here, so that you can click the links and than read the codes or even fork the repl.

**_Since I tried my best to work through the projects alone without watch the solution first. The code here might not be very same as Angela's final code. You can cross check my codes and Angela's to see which one you prefer._**

> By Day 30, the project is upgraded to store and read data in json and add exception handling.

Day 31 Flash Card Project

https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-31-flash-card-project-final

> In this project, I managed to fix the bug which Angela didn't mention. When we keep on removing words from the list, evantually till some point, we have learned all the words and the list becomes empty. Then the whole click right button, remove words from the list etc will cause a bunch of bugs. In my version, this bug is handled. I provide a short version of csv file with only 5 words so that you can test the project with it. After learning all the words, instead of showing the next card which does not exist, my version will give you a congratulation message. And very important, the to_learn_file.csv will be deleted from the folder. An empty csv file will cause the program to crash when you next time run it.
