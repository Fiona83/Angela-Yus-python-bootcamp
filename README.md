# Angela-Yus-python-bootcampe 
This repository contains the projects I did based on Angela Yu's 100 Days of python bootcamp. 

The projects are done on Replit and since I haven't found a way to link multiple Replit repls into one Github Repository, I just put links here, so that you can click the links and than read the codes or even fork the repl.

## Useful tools
1. Free tools to draw flowcharts

https://app.diagrams.net/

This tool can draw online and save the charts on your harddisc. It also has a desktop version which you can download.

2. Online code visualization / debugger

[pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/)

Just paste your code into the website and click next. It simulates a debugging process and visualize the input and output of the code. It is very helpful to understand hwo the code runs and to debug the code.

3. ASCII Art Generator

This online small tool helps you to generate ASCII Art to be used as logo for your program.
