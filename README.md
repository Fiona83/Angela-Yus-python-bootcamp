# Angela-Yus-python-bootcampe 
This repository contains the projects I did based on Angela Yu's 100 Days of python bootcamp. 

The projects are done on Replit and since I haven't found a way to link multiple Replit repls into one Github Repository, I just put links here, so that you can click the links and than read the codes or even fork the repl.

**_Since I tried my best to work through the projects alone without watch the solution first. The code here might not be very same as Angela's final code. You can cross check my codes and Angela's to see which one you prefer._**

## Useful APIs

1. Kanye West Quotes 

[Website](https://kanye.rest/)   [API Endpoint](https://api.kanye.rest)

This API is a free access REST API. It returns a random quote in json format. 

2. [Sunset and Sunrise times API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api)

This API can give you the time of sunrise and sunset according your latitude and longtitude. It is also free accessable.

3. [ISS (International Space Staton) Current Location API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/)

This API returns the current location (Lontitude, Latitude) of ISS in json format. It is free accessable.

4. [Open Trivia Databaset](https://opentdb.com/)

This website is a free open source database for commen questions. You can use its api to generate a list of questions and use it for your code. The API can include parameters to create a subset of the questions.

5. [Openweather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

With different parameters this API returns weather forecast in different scope. In order to use this API, a registration is required. After you sign up for the API, you will have a API key as credential. For the "Current Weather Data" the access is free without any subscription. However for Angela's project with hourly weather forecast, you have to use the **"One Call API"**. **It requires a subscription with credit card.** However it has 1000 requests free every day. So when you subscribe the API, remember to limit the daily requests down to 1000 *(By default it is set to 2000)*. In this case you don't need to worry about exceed the limit and have to pay money for the requests.

The response is in json format. Use the [online json viewer](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) to read the data will make your life much easier.

6. [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

This API can send SMS to your phone number. It reqires a registration and with a start bonus for about 15 dollors you can try it for free. Within the [Twilio SMS Python Quickstart Document](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python) you can even find a sample code to start with. You just need to change the ID and the token to your own and also the phone numbers, both the sender's number and the receiver's number. Twilio will give you a virtual number as sender's number. 

7. [Free Stock APIs](https://www.alphavantage.co/)

This API returns stock price in different scopes. A registration is required. As individual you are allowed to use this API for free.

8. [News API](https://newsapi.org/)

This API gives you the news all around the world, even in different language. A registration for API key is required. And it is free for non-commerical purpose.

9. [Pixela API](https://pixe.la/)

This is a very interesting API. It allows you to post, put and delete data from your pixela graphic. You can use it to generate a very nice pixel graphic to trace your habbits or activities. The API doesn't require a normal registration but in order to use it you do have to create a user first. You can choose the user name and the token as you like. After creating the user you are able to create and edit your pixel graphic.

10. [Nutrition and Exercise API](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api)

This API can track your nutritions and exercises. The interest thing here is you can use human language to decribe your activity. For example you can tell the API that you ran for 3 kilometer and it will automatically catergory your activitiy and calculate according to your age and gender the calories. For normal individuals the API is free to use.

11. [Sheety API](https://sheety.co/)

This API allows you to interactive with your google sheets. You can read, write and update the rows in your google sheet. However it allows only 200 rows requests per month which will be very fast used up. Therefore I recommend not to use this sheety API but the original google sheets API.

12. [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/)

Google sheets API can be used to read, write and update the google sheets.

Day 28 [Pomodoro](https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-28-Pomodoro-final)

> For this project, I added more funktions to the promodoro such as pause the timer and resume it. Angela's solution didn't check some of the corner case such as if the user click the start button more than once. The original version has bug in this case.

Day 29 [Password Manager](https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-29-password-manager)

> By Day 30, the project is upgraded to store and read data in json and add exception handling.

Day 31 [Flash Card Project](https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-31-flash-card-project-final)

> In this project, I managed to fix the bug which Angela didn't mention. When we keep on removing words from the list, evantually till some point, we have learned all the words and the list becomes empty. Then the whole click right button, remove words from the list etc will cause a bunch of bugs. In my version, this bug is handled. I provide a short version of csv file with only 5 words so that you can test the project with it. After learning all the words, instead of showing the next card which does not exist, my version will give you a congratulation message. And very important, the to_learn_file.csv will be deleted from the folder. An empty csv file will cause the program to crash when you next time run it.

Day 32 [Birthday Wisher](https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-32-birthday-wisher-final)

> In this project, I haven't used Angela's approach to create the dictionary like {(month, day): data_row}. Because this approach has one problem. If we have more than one person with the same birthday, it will only give you the last one in the csv file. Dictionary cannot have two identical keys. My version is able to send birthday emails to more than one person when they have the same birthday.

Day 33 [Kanye Quotes](https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-33-kanye-quotes-final)

Day 33 [ISS Overhead](https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-33-issoverhead-final)

Day 34 [Quizzler App](https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-34-quizzler-app-final)

Day 35 [Rain Alert](https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-35-rain-alert-final)

> For this project, instead of sending SMS I used Email as an alert. Because I don't want to sign up a bounch of account.

> While doing this project, I was really struggling with the environment variables. When I used export in my terminal, the variable will be created temporary. When I closed my terminal window, the variables are gone. Then I have to googled a little bit and ended up writing export command in my .bash_profile file. After that, the variables are permenant set. However when I ran my code in pycharm or in terminal windows within Atom, they both returned None for my variables. After long digging, I finally found out that both pycharm and Atom have to be restarted after the variable been set, so that they can get the values from the system. So if you are also struggling with the environment varialbles, remember to restart your pycharm. 

> Here is a document with different ways to import environment variables into a python project. You might want to check it if you do not want to mess up the system file. [Using Environment Variables in Python](./Using_Environment_Variable_in_Python.md)

Day 36 [Stock News](https://replit.com/@Fiona83/Day-36-stock-news-final)

> For this project, also using Email instead of sending SMS. Interesting thing is the normal sendmail function in smtp library is not able to treat unicode. If you have unicode letters which is out of the range of ASCII, you will get a traceback. In order to solve this problem, I used email library to encode the message, so that the sendmail function can handle the unicode letters and emojis in the mail.
