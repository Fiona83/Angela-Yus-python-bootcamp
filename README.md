# Angela-Yus-python-bootcampe 
This repository contains the projects I did based on Angela Yu's 100 Days of python bootcamp. 

The projects are done on Replit and since I haven't found a way to link multiple Replit repls into one Github Repository, I just put links here, so that you can click the links and than read the codes or even fork the repl.

**_Since I tried my best to work through the projects alone without watch the solution first. The code here might not be very same as Angela's final code. You can cross check my codes and Angela's to see which one you prefer._**

## Useful tools
